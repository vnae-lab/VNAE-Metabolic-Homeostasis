# VNAE-Metabolic-Homeostasis

This repository explores the geometric stability of complex biochemical networks using the VNAE framework. By modeling 1,200+ metabolic variables, we demonstrate that homeostasis is a topological guarantee driven by structural asymmetry (θ) and Riemannian curvature (K), ensuring systemic convergence even under persistent oxidative stress or dietary shocks.
